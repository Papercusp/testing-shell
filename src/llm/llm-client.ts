/**
 * Generic LLM-client helpers for the sim-user + judge.
 *
 * The concrete LLM transport (`llmCall`) is NOT defined here — it is an
 * injected seam (`LlmCallFn` in ./deps), because the real implementation is
 * host-specific (the operator routes through its `runAgentChat` + credentials).
 * This module holds only the host-agnostic pieces every consumer needs:
 * pricing, cost estimation, JSON recovery, and the call opts/result shapes.
 *
 * The operator's concrete `llmCall` (which imports its agent-chat-stream +
 * credentials) and `isLlmAvailable` (which reads operator credentials) stay
 * operator-side and are injected into the runner via `RunnerDeps.llmCall`.
