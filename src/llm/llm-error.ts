/**
 * Typed LLM-call error.
 *
 * A host's concrete `llmCall` (the gym judge / sim-user / generators) used to
 * throw a bare `Error(message)` on a failed turn, which a rate-limited judge
 * turned into a thrown exception that aborted the WHOLE A/B run. `LlmCallError`
 * instead carries a classified `TurnError` so an A/B loop can tell a
 * `rate_limited` failure (pause + resume) from a permanent one (skip) — never
 * crashing the run.
 *
 * This lib defines a minimal local `TurnError` shape (structurally matching the
 * host agent taxonomy) so it carries NO host import — a host's richer
 * `TurnError` assigns into this type without a cast.
